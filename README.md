# Hi, I'm Pratheeksha S Devadiga 👋
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer building scalable AI systems that transform data into impactful, real-world solutions.<br><br>
I specialize in developing end-to-end ML and Generative AI applications, from data engineering and model optimization to deploying real-time intelligent systems.

## What I've Built

### [Brain Tumor Prediction System](https://brain-tumor-prediction-app-app-7uxnliu2gdefmyu5sgoamh.streamlit.app/)

- Developed a machine learning model using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI images.  
- Performed image preprocessing and feature extraction to improve model performance.  
- Deployed a Streamlit web application for real-time MRI-based brain tumor prediction.

### [Multimodal Medical Assistant (Voice, Image & Text)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pratheekshasdevadiga19/ai_doctor_with_vision_and_voice)

- Built a multimodal AI assistant capable of analyzing medical images and voice queries to generate health insights using LLMs.  
- Integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech for seamless conversational interaction.  
- Deployed the application on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time accessibility.
