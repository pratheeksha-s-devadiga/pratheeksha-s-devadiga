## 👩‍💻 About Me

Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, and Generative AI.

I build end-to-end machine learning systems — from data preprocessing and model development to real-time deployment using Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.

My interests include applied AI, multimodal systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and production-ready ML applications.
